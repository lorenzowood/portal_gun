Portal gun plan

Software
[X] Test Claudeâ€™s effort
[X] Fix it
-- Some tests passed in Python but failed in MicroPython on the Pi -- notably more sophisticated regex
-- Could do with MicroPython on desktop for running more accurate tests
[X] Signed off and loaded onto Pi

Mounting optical encoder
[X] Review candidate design
[X] Refine if necessary
[X] Final 3D prints produced

Mounting the display
[X] Design something
[X] Print it
[X] Test it
[X] Refine if necessary
[X] Final 3D prints produced

Mounting the LEDs
[X] Design black front piece
[X] Print it
[X] Test it
[X] Refine if necessary
[X] Final 3D prints produced

Mounting the neopixels
-- Reuse the connector we're currently using
[X] Pick a strip length
-- 20
[X] Cut and remove external sheath
[X] Test fit inside tube
[X] Design mount if required
-- cap for the end of the tube to stop the neopixels springing out and making it easier to glue
[X] Print it
[X] Test it
[X] Final 3D prints produced

Lid
[X] Review test printed lid
[X] Modify as required
-- Magnets for mounting?
-- Only mods were reducing the size of the display hole and removing the screw holes
[X] Print it
[X] Test it
[X] Final 3D prints produced

Base
[X] Final 3D print produced
-- No time to print another one

Fitting in hardware
[X] Test-fit hardware
# Design a support frame
# Print it
# Test it
-- Didn't bother with a support frame
[X] Solder up pins/cables for production Pi
-- Made connection wires by cutting up the Dupont wires
-- Soldered directly to the Pi. Terrible idea.
-- Twisted power wires together, soldered badly and shrink-wrapped. Also not great.
[X] Load software onto production Pi
# Test production hardware
-- Was already in shell
[X] Mount in shell
[X] Test production hardware in shell
-- Didn't work. Issues:
-- Wired up display to the wrong pins on the Pi. Fixed that in software.
-- Also wired them up backwards. Fixed that in hardware -- reversed the Dupont connectors on the display.
-- Neopixels erratic then non-functional. Tried: new batteries; reflowing the solder joint on GP16; switching to GP18; switching to a different strip of pixels. All hopeless. Think  I blew up the Pi somewhat with all the heat and compromised tracks
[ ] Portal gun complete
-- Only complete in the sense that I bailed, pulled out most of the electronics and glued everything together. Actually a really nice dumb prop that did the job very well.
